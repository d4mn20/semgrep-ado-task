# Semgrep Scan Task for Azure Pipelines

# Overview
The Semgrep Scan Task is an Azure Pipelines extension that integrates Semgrep, a fast and open-source static analysis tool, into your CI/CD workflows. It scans your code for bugs, enforces code standards, and helps improve code quality.

## Features
- Run Semgrep scans as part of your Azure Pipelines workflow.
- Send scan results to the “ddconnector” service for further processing and management.

# Getting Started
  1. Prerequisites:
      - Ensure you have an Azure DevOps organization and project set up.
      - Install the Azure Pipelines extension for Visual Studio Code (if not already installed).

  2. Installation:
      - Clone this repository to your local machine.
      - Add the necessary icons to the images folders:
        - extension-icon.png: Icon for the extension.
        - task-icon.png: Icon for the Semgrep scan task.
  
      - Define the GUIDs for the extension and the task in the appropriate files.

  3. Configuration:
      - Configure the Semgrep scan task:
        - Specify the Semgrep ruleset or custom rules you want to use.
        - Set up the connection to the “ms-ddconnector” microservice.
      - Define the Semgrep configuration in the .semgrep.yml file.

  4. Build and Test:
      - Build your extension by running the necessary build commands.
      - Test the extension locally using the Azure Pipelines extension for Visual Studio Code.

  5. Package as .vsix:
      - Use the Azure Pipelines extension packaging tool to create a .vsix package.
      - Include the necessary icons and configuration files.

# Usage
  1. Add the Semgrep Scan Task to your Azure Pipelines YAML file:
  ```yaml
    jobs:
      - job: RunSemgrepScan
        steps:
          - task: SemgrepScan@1
  ```

  2. Trigger the pipeline, and Semgrep will scan your code during the build process.
  3. View the scan results in the Azure Pipelines UI or check the “ms-ddconnector” microservice for further analysis.

# Educational Purpose
  This extension serves as an educational resource for integrating Semgrep into Azure Pipelines. 
  By exploring the code and configuration, developers can learn how to set up static analysis scans, 
  handle scan results, and connect with other microservices like “ms-ddconnector.” 
  Feel free to experiment, modify, and enhance this extension to deepen your understanding of DevSecOps practices.
